 Update By Zeninari Added Items:

VitaShell 2.02 Revisions - September 6th, 2024

	- obviously updated the README.md file
	- Updated preview images
	- Updated context.png
	- Updated context_more.png
	- Updated context_clippy.png

Quality Of Life:

	- Added context_nobar.png (removes the bars from the UI)
	- Added and renamed context.bar.png (default bar image, copy this when 	you want to swap back to the original and rename to context.png)
	- Added context_more_clippy.png
	- Added more_noclippy.png (removes clippy from where i moved him due to no space)
	- Added bg_audioplayer_98.png (alternate bg for media player, does require a text color swap!)
	- Added bg_audioplayer_black.png (this is always here and is the default. is a separate file from bg_audioplayer.png despite being the 	same.)
	- renamed the old preview image files to preview#_old.jpg (didn't convert to png to keep the authenticity of the original files)
	- added 2 more zip downloads one thats compressed and one thats fully compressed if your having issues.
 	- added the original PSD files i used to edit the textures in case someone wants to do somthing with them idk lol

 Known Issues: 
	 
  	- becasuse of how vitashell renders the images only the main menu type with the context_bar.png image will be valid. if its that much of an issue please use the context_nobar.png instead. if anyone knows how to make vitashell render multiple images based on what menu is currently active that would be very helpful!
